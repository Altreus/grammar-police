The only particularly advanced open-source grammar checker out there seems to
be the CMU Link Grammar Parser. I'm no expert so I don't understand its theory
(because I didn't read it through) but it doesn't seem to do what I want. That
is because I don't want a grammar parser, I want a grammar checker to
complement my spell-checker. (Ironically, 'spell checker' is grammatically
improper.)

I want to create an open-source grammar checker that will offer suggestions. It
will try to understand things like context and to figure out attachments of
clauses and things.

This is a fairly major undertaking and I hope it can generate some interest,
and perhaps some debate. Currently it is just a README file, though.

I'm going to use Perl because there are a few modules on there that might help
kick off the project and get us on our way.
